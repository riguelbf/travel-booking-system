# AWS Architecture for the Travel Booking System

## 1. Architecture Overview

The architecture utilizes the following AWS services:

	•	Amazon Route 53
	•	Amazon CloudFront
	•	Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
	•	Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
	•	Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
	•	AWS Fargate
	•	Amazon API Gateway
	•	AWS Lambda
	•	Amazon RDS
	•	Amazon DynamoDB
	•	Amazon ElastiCache
	•	Amazon S3
	•	AWS CloudWatch
	•	AWS CloudTrail
	•	AWS WAF
	•	AWS IAM
	•	Amazon SNS/SQS

## 2. Component Description

2.1. Network and Security Layer

	•	Amazon Route 53: Manages DNS and directs traffic to CloudFront.
	•	Amazon CloudFront: CDN that accelerates the delivery of static and dynamic content.
	•	AWS WAF: Web application firewall integrated with CloudFront for protection against common threats.
	•	Amazon VPC: Creates an isolated virtual network for AWS resources.
	•	Public and Private Subnets: Separation of internet-facing resources and backend.
	•	AWS IAM: Manages identities and access permissions.

2.2. Application Layer

	•	Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes traffic among application instances in different availability zones.
	•	Amazon ECS/EKS with AWS Fargate: Manages containers for microservices applications without server management.
	•	Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.

2.3. Business Logic Layer

	•	Amazon API Gateway: Manages RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend.
	•	AWS Lambda: Runs serverless functions for tasks like payment processing and notifications.
	•	Amazon SNS/SQS: Messaging services for asynchronous communication and notifications.

2.4. Data Layer

	•	Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ): Managed relational database for transactional data.
	•	Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database for high-speed and scalable data.
	•	Amazon ElastiCache: In-memory cache (Redis/Memcached) to improve performance.
	•	Amazon S3: Stores static objects like images and backups.

2.5. Monitoring and Logging

	•	AWS CloudWatch: Monitoring of metrics and logs.
	•	AWS CloudTrail: Audit logging of activities in the AWS account.

## 3. Data Flow

	1.	Client: The user accesses the website or mobile app.
	2.	Amazon Route 53: Resolves the domain and directs to CloudFront.
	3.	Amazon CloudFront: Provides cached static content or forwards dynamic requests.
	4.	AWS WAF: Inspects traffic for threat protection.
	5.	Elastic Load Balancer: Distributes requests among application instances.
	6.	Amazon ECS/EKS: Runs application containers.
	7.	Amazon API Gateway: Manages APIs and forwards to backend services.
	8.	AWS Lambda: Executes serverless functions as needed.
	9.	Data Layer: The application interacts with RDS, DynamoDB, or ElastiCache.
	10.	Amazon S3: Stores and retrieves static files.
	11.	Amazon SNS/SQS: Manages messages and notifications.
	12.	Monitoring: CloudWatch and CloudTrail record metrics and logs.

## 4. Architecture Considerations

	•	High Availability: Deployment across multiple availability zones.
	•	Scalability: Use of Auto Scaling and managed services.
	•	Security: Use of VPC, private subnets, security groups, and IAM.
	•	Performance: CloudFront, ElastiCache, and database optimizations.
	•	Cost: Efficient use of resources to optimize expenses.

## 5. Architecture Diagram

	1.	Use Diagramming Tools:
	•	AWS Architecture Icons: Download official AWS icons from the AWS Architecture Icons page.
	•	Diagramming Software: Utilize tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, Microsoft Visio, or the AWS Architecture Diagramming Tool.
	2.	Diagram Structure:
	•	Presentation Layer:
	•	Place Amazon Route 53 at the top.
	•	Connect it to Amazon CloudFront, which is linked to AWS WAF.
	•	Application Layer:
	•	AWS WAF connects to the Elastic Load Balancer.
	•	The ELB distributes traffic to application instances in Amazon ECS/EKS within a VPC.
	•	Business Logic Layer:
	•	Application instances communicate with Amazon API Gateway.
	•	AWS Lambda is connected for serverless functions.
	•	Data Layer:
	•	Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache are placed in private subnets.
	•	Amazon S3 is accessible for object storage.
	•	Messaging Layer:
	•	Amazon SNS/SQS connected to the application for asynchronous communication.
	•	Monitoring and Security:
	•	AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail monitor all components.
	•	AWS IAM manages permissions and access.
	3.	Design Tips:
	•	Layer Separation: Clearly separate different layers (Presentation, Application, Business Logic, Data, etc.) in your diagram.
	•	Service Icons: Use the official AWS icons to represent services accurately.
	•	Connections: Use arrows to indicate data flow and interactions between services.
	•	Annotations: Add notes or labels to clarify components and their roles.
